1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
- 6 hours
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
   -writing/documentation: 3 hours
   -brainstorming/information gathering: 2 hours
   -meetings: 1 hour
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?***
  -This week began with a team meeting to evaluate options and discuss the proposal draft. After much discussion we decided to brainstorm for a new idea which would better meat the requirements. Ideas discussed included a variation of the litter robot & sign language system, security system and a nutrition scanner system.
   It was decided that the nutrition scanner was the idea that best met the requirements. 
  -The second part was working on the proposal rough draft. To do this I researched into how the raspberry pi communicates with other devices, and determined that a NEMA 17 motor controller would be used to controll the servo motor and a HX711 would be required for digitally computing weight of items.
  -Created deployment diagrams and use cases for the system based off of the research and finished writing the proposal.
  -Reviewed feedback from peers and finished final proposal draft.
