1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
- 10 hours
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***

  -meetings: 1 hour
  -testing: 4 hours
  -software implementation: 5 hours
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?***
  -This week we completed the unit-tests for the project. I was responsible for doing the unit tests for the web application and the server. I Also implemented most of the functionality
  for the web app and the server. A large part of the time was spent troubleshooting and figuring out errors, and then figuring out how to implement unit tests in a browser.
  -The server now successfully routes requests from the client, and sends the appropriate response. The user can now log in with google and there user id and info is stored in firebase.
   
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - Good progress was made not too many large obstacles that will prevent us from completing the project.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Next week I will fix some bugs that occured when writing to firebase, I will clean up some of the code and add better documentation and finish the client web application.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
  - Need help with writing to firebase from server. The format of the json is not in the write form.
