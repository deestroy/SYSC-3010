1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
- 6 hours
2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
    1. Top item: Brainstorming a new idea which fits the project criteria, 2 hours
    2. 2nd item: Writing the project proposal and reviewing proposals, 3 hours
    3. 3rd item: Attending team meetings, 1 hour
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?***
- This week we met to re evealuate our idea. We realized the previous idea had failed to meet all of the requirements outlined in the project document. Therefore, we decided to come up with a new idea. Our initial options was a sign language interpreter and a security system. We realized the that the former is unfeasible and the latter we did not like as a group. We finally arrived at a calorie counting machine which can use a weighing machine for more accuracy
- Based on the idea above, we wrote the project proposal rough draft. We looked at all the sensors we could used along side the Raspberry Pi. We decided that the NEMA 17 controller and it's corresponding motor would be the best fit due to the price and ease of use. HX711 would be used as the weight sensor based on another person's example weighing project. We met as a group to confirm the components.
- I wrote Sections 1, 4, 5, and 6 of the propsal draft and during class, we reviewed others feedbacks. We then reviewed the feedback of the feedback.
  - Based on the feedback, we edited the proposal
   
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - After the confusion of flip-floping betweeen ideas, the project is finally up to par. We can start properly dicussing the idea without fear that the project may be scrapped. I could have added more detail when writing my sections (this was the biggest feedback) and I made sure to encorperate it in the final document.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Next week we need to start working on the design document and complete it by Friday so we can have a group peer review
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
- N/A
