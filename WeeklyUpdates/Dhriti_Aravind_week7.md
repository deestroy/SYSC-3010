3.  ***What did you accomplish this week?*** *(Be specific)*

-   Sketched and designed the UI for the design document (section 4) using Figma. I was able to prototype and draw what the final UI would look like and insert the graphics. From there, I was able to draw the interaction diagram. 
-    Completed section 5 of the detailed design document using Frizting and drew the wiring between the different hardware compnents. Started wiring the diagram for the prototype but was unable to complete it. 

4.  ***How do you feel about your progress?*** *(brief, free-form
    reflection)*

-   Our group is fully on track to be completing the project on time. I have been slacking and don't feel that I have gotten the diagrams done faster. Midterms were this week so I was very distracted and need to contribute the group discussions more.
