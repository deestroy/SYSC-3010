Weekly Individual Project Update Report
Group number: L1-G3
Student name: Dhriti Aravind
Week: 9

    How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)

    6 hours

    Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:* (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
        Top item: Motor implementation - tested several different motors to see which is the easiest to control. Coded the test unit test - 2 hrs
        2nd item: Weight Sensor implementation - soldered and connected the hx711 and tried to connect the weight sensor. Also tried simulating the hardware - 3 hr
        3rd item: Discussed ITP Peer Review - 1 hr

    What did you accomplish this week? (Be specific)
    - Tested several different motors to see which is the easiest to control. Although the NEMA 17 was the motor mentioned in the design doument, I decided to test out some other, less power consuming motors like the DXW90 servo motor. I was able to implement the motor so it would move accurately to the nearest 2 decimals inputed.
    - Soldered and connected the hx711 and tried to connect the weight sensor using the breadboard. The sensing module itself was not accurate because it needed to be elevated. I need to build a elevation system. Also tried simulating the hardware to get it ready for the unit testing.
    - Reviewed the ITP results with group members

    How do you feel about your progress? (brief, free-form reflection)
    - I feel like we as a group are getting better at communicating. I am also getting annoyed by the finickiness of the sensor. I need to be more patient with the sensors.

    What are you planning to do next week? (give specific goals)
    - Complete tech memo
    - Work with Keith to update unit testing
    - Build platform for the sensor to rest on.

    Is anything blocking you that you need from others? (What do you need from whom)
