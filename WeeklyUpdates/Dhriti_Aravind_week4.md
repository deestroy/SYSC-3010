___
1. **How many hours did you spend on the project this week? (0-10)**
- 4 hours

2. **Give rough breakdown of hours spent on 1-3 of the following:***
   (meetings, information gathering, design, research, brainstorming, evaluating options, prototyping options, writing/documenting, refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
   1. Top item: Brainstorming a new idea which fits the project criteria, 2 hours
   2. 2nd item: Writing the project pre-proposal, 2 hours
3. ***What did you accomplish this week?*** _(Be specific)_
  - Based on our previous idea, (an autonomus robot which can pick trash up) we wrote the project pre-proposal and submitted it for peer review. I primarily focused on writing a brief discription regarding how the robot will idenitify and collect the waste to place in the trash bin. 
  - During the team meeting, we re-evaluated the previous idea because it did not adequately fit the requirements because it did not meaningfully follow the minimal criteria (ex. use the required database, bidirectional GUI and notification). From there, as a group, we decided restart the brainstorming process. Our final idea which meets all the criteria is camera that interprets sign language and rotates and the person's hand moves. It will access a public database to decipher the different hand motions. The translation will be relayed to the SenseHat and will print out in plain English. There will also be a GUI on the monitor screen which will be fully defined next week.
 
4. ***How do you feel about your progress?*** _(brief, free-form reflection)_
  - Although as a team we did do well, I personally think I could have double checked the requirements for the project and prevented us from restarting. Restarting the project effectively gives us no previous critiques from the pre-proposal that we can build upon. I feel like I should slow down, think through, and communicate more effectively my thoughts about the project in a more understandable way so we can work together in line.
5. ***What are you planning to do next week***? _(give specific goals)_
  - Start and compelete writing sections 1, 4, 6 & 5 of the project proposal by February 8. Complete the document and the first round of self editing by Feburary 7. Complete peer revisions during a team meeting to ensure the grammar, sentence structure and readability is clear to the peer editor.
  -  Look for ASL image databases with hand gestures and the English translations. Understand and download the tools/programming languages are required to recognize the different gestures.
6. ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** _(What do you need from whom)_
- Keith: Finish section 2 of the proposal by February 7
- Thomas: Finish section 3 of the proposal by February 8
