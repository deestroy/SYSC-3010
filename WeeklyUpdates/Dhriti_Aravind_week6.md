    refactoring, testing, software implementation, hardware implementation)
    1.  Top item: Meetings: discussed components required for our project - 20 mins
    2.  2nd item: Meetings: started dicussing about roles for the design document - 5 mins

3.  ***What did you accomplish this week?*** *(Be specific)*

-   We dicussed the components related to the project that each of us have at home. We settled on the NEMA motor and A9 motor controller that I own.
4.  ***How do you feel about your progress?*** *(brief, free-form
    reflection)*
-   Our group is fully on track to be completing the project on time. We have discussed writing the design document template prior to next weeks deadline because midterms are fast arriving. With better scheduling we can be ahead of schedule and provide more time for the testing phase.

5.  ***What are you planning to do next week***? *(give specific goals)*

-   Assign tasks for the design document and begin the document when the design document is posted on BrightSpace.
-   Start looking for how to implement the barcode. Should be able to scan one barcode by the end of next week.

6.  ***Is anything blocking you that you need from others?*** *(What doyou need from whom)*

-   Design Document from the Professor
